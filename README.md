## Introduction
My name is Sophia Sadiq and I am a student at the University of Guelph. I am currently enrolled in Biological & Biomedical Engineering. I hope to gain knowledge and experience from various different projects, jobs, and extracurriculars.

## University Course Design Projects <br/>
## **Engineering Design I: Teddy Bear Wheelchair (Robotic Device)** <br/>
In our first-year design course (ENGG*1100), my interdisciplinary team and I were tasked with designing, building, and coding a wheelchair for a teddy bear. The project was both fun and challenging as we had to ensure the wheelchair could complete various tests to assess its performance and accuracy. One of the most interesting parts of the project was a target-practice test, where we had to integrate a ping-pong projectile system into the design. It was a great way to apply our knowledge and work together as a team.

**Arranging the Breadboard and Components**
First, I placed the motor driver IC on the breadboard just as it appears in the picture above. I make sure it’s positioned in a central location on the breadboard to easily connect it to other components. Then, I grab some jumper wires and start connecting the Arduino to the breadboard. I usually like to use different colors for different purposes—red for power, black for ground, and other colors for signal lines, which helps me keep track of the connections more easily.

**Connecting the Motor**
Next, I attached the motor to the motor driver. I double-checked the motor’s documentation to make sure I’m aware of its current and voltage requirements. This ensures I make the connections securely and avoid any potential short circuits or damage to the motor and driver. I connect the motor leads to the output terminals of the motor driver, carefully noting the polarity to ensure correct directional movement.

**Power Connections**
Finally, I connected the battery clip to the breadboard. I plugged the red wire into the breadboard’s positive rail and the black wire into the negative rail. I then used jumper wires to extend power from the breadboard’s power rails to both the Arduino and the motor driver IC. It’s crucial to make sure that both components received the correct voltage; for the Arduino, it's typically 5V, and the motor driver’s voltage varied depending on the motor's specifications.

These sketches are a rough look on how the final product was going to look like.

Initially, the vehicle was powered directly by a battery source, but we observed that we could enhance the setup. To do this, we decided to reroute one of the red wires. Originally, this wire was connected directly to the battery. We changed its connection point on the breadboard to a different slot specifically meant for a stable voltage supply.

This alteration was crucial because it allowed us to better manage the power distribution across the vehicle's circuit. By connecting the red wire to a voltage slot on the breadboard, we effectively centralized the power distribution, which helped in stabilizing the motor operation and the overall functionality of the vehicle. It’s a simple change, but it makes the vehicle more reliable because the voltage regulation is more consistent.

After making this change, we thoroughly tested the vehicle to ensure it operated correctly. We wanted to be certain that it could move back and forth reliably, which it did, proving our modification was successful. This was a great relief and a point of satisfaction for us, as it confirmed our understanding and application of basic electronic and power distribution principles.

Chassis and Plates: The chassis is built from metal plates with multiple holes. These perforations allow me to easily adjust and align the motor and other components for optimal placement.

Motor Installation: I've mounted the motor using metal brackets to ensure it stays securely in place. This is crucial to avoid vibrations or misalignments that could hamper performance.

Wiring: There are several wires visible, connected to the motor and potentially other parts. I've taken care to route and secure these wires to prevent any interference or damage during the robot's operation.

Hardware: I've used screws and bolts to assemble the plates and secure the motor. Choosing the right hardware is essential to maintain the structural integrity of the vehicle.

Wheels and Axles: The wheels are partially visible, and I've carefully aligned their axles to ensure smooth movement and steering.

## **Engineering Design II: 3D Printed Toy** <br/>
In my Engineering and Design II course, we're building on our design skills by working in teams to reverse engineer everyday objects and create solutions to complex design problems. Our project this semester is to design a 3D-printed toy that fits in a Kinder Egg, adheres to size and weight constraints, and incorporates a mechanism to store and release energy for motion or projectile launching.
